Given n plays at a theater with their starting and ending time (expressed as integers), determine the number of non-overlapping full plays a spectator can watch.
(MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NON-OVERLAPPING INTERVALS ON AN AXIS)
ex. IN:
        10
        5 14
        14 17
        8 13
        13 15
        15 17
        3 6
        4 7
        6 9
        11 14
        10 11
    OUT:
        5
We can choose [3, 6], [6, 9], [10, 11], [11, 14] and [14, 17].

Time Complexity: O(n*log n) (sorting)
Additional Space: O(n)
