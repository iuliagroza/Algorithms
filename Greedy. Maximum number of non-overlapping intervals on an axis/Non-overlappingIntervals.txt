PSEUDOCODE

Greedy(C)  (C is the candidate set)
{
  S <- Ø  (S is the solution set. It is initially empty)
  while C != Ø
  {
    choose(x)  (x is one element that meets all the requirements)
    if possible(S U {x})
    {
      S <- S U {x}
      C <- C \ {x}  (we eliminate x from the candidate set)
    }
  }
  Output S
}


Given n plays at a theater with their starting and ending time (expressed as integers), determine the number of non-overlapping full plays a spectator can watch.
(MAXIMUM NUMBER OF NON-OVERLAPPING INTERVALS ON AN AXIS)
ex. IN:
        10
        5 14
        14 17
        8 13
        13 15
        15 17
        3 6
        4 7
        6 9
        11 14
        10 11
    OUT:
        5
We can choose [3, 6], [6, 9], [10, 11], [11, 14] and [14, 17].
