Time Complexity: O(|V|+|E|), where |V| is the number of vertices and |E| the number of edges
Space Complexity: O(|V|)

PSEUDOCODE

(We represent the graph using an adjacency list G[][], where G[vertex1][vertex2]==G[vertex2][vertex1]==True only if vertex1 and vertex2 are adjacent. We also make use of a frequency array vis[] to see which nodes we have already visited.)

DFS(node)
{
    vis[node] <- 1
    for i=1, i<=G[node].length, i<-i+1
    {
        if vis[G[node][i]] == False
        {
            DFS(i)
        }
    }
}
