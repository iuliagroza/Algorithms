### Contribution guide
1. Create an **issue** where you document your contribution (i.e. mention the **algorithm** you want to develop the source code for, and the **programming language**).
2. Propose your changes in a **new branch** with the name `<issue_id> <algorithm_name> <programming_language>` and create a **pull request**.
3. **[IMPORTANT]** Please make sure to be consistent in terms of project/directories structure and style guide!
4. Wait for review & approvals, and be proud of yourself :) Your contribution is highly appreciated!
